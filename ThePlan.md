# The Plan 

### Logistics Planning 
1) Test libraries, try to figure out how to make a web app using Ocaml/Rescript, connect back-end to front-end 
2) Start with simple tic-tac-toe game 
3) Basic ultimate
4) Complex ultimate


### Basic Tic-Tac-Toe Game Rules 
1) Each player alternates taking turns (respective X and O) 
2) Squares cannot be written over 
3) 3-in-a-row means game is over, check after each turn for win-con 

### Basic Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation
1) Board will be a 2d array
2) Each cell will either be blank, have an X, or an O
3) Figure out how to check if someone has won 
4) If all squares filled and neither have won, then it's a draw 
5) Freeze the game if someone wins or it's a draw
